TermLayout is a text\-mode HTML formatter for Unix terminals which supports:
.IP "\[ci]" 4
Ruby markup (multiple rt and rb elements are stacked)
.IP "\[ci]" 4
Tables (including nesting and alignment)
.IP "\[ci]" 4
Wide characters (uses locale settings from LC_CTYPE, LANG etc)
.IP "\[ci]" 4
Smaller terminal sizes\. In some cases a table will still end up being wider than the terminal and not easily reï¬‚owable; if that happens then at least each cell should fit\. But in many cases TermLayout can arrange for no horizontal scrolling to be necessary\.
.IP "" 0
.P
Unrecognised markup is left in the output for inspection\.

TermLayout is \fInot\fR a Web browser: it has no facilities for navigating links\. It is meant only for formatting text on a terminal using HTML markup\. I wrote it when I wanted to page through a document with Ruby markup in fbterm but couldn't find a text\-mode browser that would format this markup correctly\.

If you are using TermLayout with an annotator generated by Annotator Generator, you might also be interested in \fBtmux\-annotator\.sh\fR which sets up tmux with a "hotkey" to annotate the current screen and display the result in TermLayout\.
